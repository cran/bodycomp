\title{Percent Body Fat Estimates Using Sloan and Weir (1970).}
\usage{
Sloan.2sites(Sex, TH, SB, SI, TR, Equation, Output.format)
}
\arguments{
\item{Sex}{a value or a vector representing the sex declared by the subject. Two possible choices: 0 or 1.}

\item{TH}{a value or a vector representing Thigh Skinfold measurement. Direction of Fold: Vertical (midlin). Anatomical Reference: Inguinal crease and patella. Measurement: Fold is lifted on anterior aspect of thigh midway between inguinal crease and proximal border of patella. Body weight is shifted to left foot and caliper is applied 1 cm below fingers.}

\item{SB}{a value or a vector representing Subscapular Skinfold measurement. Direction of Fold: Diagonal. Anatomical Reference: Inferior angle of scapula. Measurement: Fold is along natural cleavage line of skin just inferior to inferior angle of scapula, with caliper applied 1 cm below fingers.}

\item{SI}{a value or a vector representing Suprailiac Skinfold measurement. Direction of Fold: Oblique. Anatomical Reference: Iliac crest. Measurement: Fold is grasped posteriorly to midaxillary line and superiorly to iliac crest along natural cleavage of skin with caliper applied 1 cm below fingers.}

\item{TR}{a value or a vector representing Triceps Skinfold measurement. Direction of Fold: Vertical (midline). Anatomical Reference: Acromial process of scapula and olecranon process of ulna. Measurement: Using a tape measure, distance between lateral projection of acromial process and inferior margin of olecranon process is measured on lateral aspect of arm with elbow flexed 90Â°. Midpoint is marked on lateral side of arm. Fold is lifted 1 cm above marked line on posterior aspect of arm. Caliper is applied at marked level.}

\item{Equation}{desired estimation equation. Two possible choices: 1 or 2.}

\item{Output.format}{desired output information. Tree possible choices: 0, 1 or 2}

\value{
Returns a data frame with the values of the \% body fat and body density from a subject assessed by skinfold measurements
}
\description{
This function calculates the percent body mass estimates based on 2 sites skinfold measurements using the equations of Sloan and Weir (1970). Population Specifications: Both sexes; Athletes; Male (aged 18-26) and Female (aged 17-25).
}
\details{
Sex:Use 0 for Male and 1 for Female. Equation: Use 1 for Siri (1961) equation or 2 for Brozek et al. (1963) equation. Output.format: Use 0 to display Percent Body Fat (\%BF) and Body Density (BD) together; use 1 to display \%BF only; use 2 to display BD only.
