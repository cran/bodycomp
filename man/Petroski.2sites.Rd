\title{Percent Body Fat Estimates Using Petroski (1995).}
\usage{
Petroski.2sites(TR, MA, Age, Equation, Output.format)
}
\arguments{
\item{TR}{a value or a vector representing Triceps Skinfold measurements. Direction of Fold: Vertical (midline). Anatomical Reference: Acromial process of scapula and olecranon process of ulna. Measurement: Using a tape measure, distance between lateral projection of acromial process and inferior margin of olecranon process is measured on lateral aspect of arm with elbow flexed 90°. Midpoint is marked on lateral side of arm. Fold is lifted 1 cm above marked line on posterior aspect of arm. Caliper is applied at marked level.}

\item{MA}{Site:  a value or a vector representing Midaxillary  Skinfold measurements.  Direction of Fold:  Oblique (Adapted from Author). Anatomical Reference:  Xiphisternal junction (point where costal cartilage of ribs 5-6 articulates with sternum, slightly above inferior tip of xiphoid process). Measurement:  Fold is taken on midaxillary line at level of xiphisternal junction. Petroski choose modifications in the verification of the AM fold for obliques because it's most used procedures in Brazil.}

\item{Age}{a value or a vector representing the age (in years) from subject assessed.}

\item{Equation}{desired estimation equation. Two possible choices: 1 or 2.}

\item{Output.format}{desired output information. Tree possible choices: 0, 1 or 2.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with the values of the \% body fat and body density from a subject assessed by skinfold measurements
}
\description{
This function calculates the percent body mass estimates based on 2 sites skinfold measurements using the equations of Petroski (1995). Population Specifications: Brazilian Males aged 18-66.
}
\details{
Equation: Use 1 for Siri (1961) equation or 2 for Brozek et al. (1963) equation. Output.format: Use 0 to display Percent Body Fat (\%BF) and Body Density (BD) together; use 1 to display \%BF only; use 2 to display BD only.
