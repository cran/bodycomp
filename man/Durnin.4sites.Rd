\title{Percent Body Fat Estimates Using Durnin and Womersley (1974).}
\usage{
Durnin.4sites(Sex, TR, BI, SB, SI, Age, Equation, Output.format)
}
\arguments{
\item{Sex}{a value or a vector representing the sex declared by the subject. Two possible choices: 0 or 1.}

\item{TR}{a value or a vector representing Triceps Skinfold measurements. Direction of Fold: Vertical (midline). Anatomical Reference: Acromial process of scapula and olecranon process of ulna. Measurement: Using a tape measure, distance between lateral projection of acromial process and inferior margin of olecranon process is measured on lateral aspect of arm with elbow flexed 90Â°. Midpoint is marked on lateral side of arm. Fold is lifted 1 cm above marked line on posterior aspect of arm. Caliper is applied at marked level.}

\item{BI}{a value a vector representing Biceps Skinfold. Direction of Fold measurements: Vertical (midline). Anatomical Reference: Biceps brachii. Measurement: Fold is lifted over belly of the biceps brachii at the level marked for the triceps and on line with anterior border of the acromial process and the antecubital fossa. Caliper is applied 1 cm below fingers.}

\item{SB}{a value or a vector representing Subscapular  Skinfold measurements. Direction of Fold: Diagonal. Anatomical Reference: Inferior angle of scapula. Measurement: Fold is along natural cleavage line of skin just inferior to inferior angle of scapula, with caliper applied 1 cm below fingers.}

\item{SI}{a value a vector representing Suprailiac Skinfold measurements. Direction of Fold: Oblique. Anatomical Reference: Iliac crest. Measurement: Fold is grasped posteriorly to midaxillary line and superiorly to iliac crest along natural cleavage of skin with caliper applied 1 cm below fingers.}

\item{Age}{a value or a vector representing the age (in years) from subject assessed.}

\item{Equation}{desired estimation equation. Two possible choices: 1 or 2.}

\item{Output.format}{desired output information. Tree possible choices: 0, 1 or 2.}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with the values of the \% body fat and body density from a subject assessed by skinfold measurements.
}
\description{
This function calculates the percent body mass estimates based on 4 sites skinfold measurements using the equations of Durnin and Womersley (1974). Population Specifications: Adults (both sexes) non athletes from UK; Male (aged 17 - 72) and Female (aged 16 - 68).
}
\details{
Sex:Use 0 for Male and 1 for Female. Equation: Use 1 for Siri (1961) equation or 2 for Brozek et al. (1963) equation. Output.format: Use 0 to display Percent Body Fat (\%BF) and Body Density (BD) together; use 1 to display \%BF only; use 2 to display BD only.
